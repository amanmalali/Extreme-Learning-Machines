## Extreme Learning Machines

An implementation of Extreme Learning Machines(ELM) and Kernel based Extreme Learning Machines(KELM) in Numpy. Thes ML algorithms can produce relativel good results with relatively small amount of data. Implemented three different types of kernals for KELM which can be specified during training

### Requirements
